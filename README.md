# JSON Resume Schema

This is an extension/adaptation of [the official JSON Resume
schema](https://github.com/ianprime0509/jsonresume-schema), provided
alongside a very small TypeScript library with type definitions and
validation functions for resume data. It is intended to be useful both
as a continuation of the original standard (which hasn't received
updates in some time) and as a utility for users of the original
standard (since any changes will be strictly backwards-compatible).

## Extensions to the standard

Once any extensions are made to the standard, this section will list
them.
